Multiple Sequence Alignments were performed over 3 principle datasets: 

*Cisplatin Binding Sequences (cisplatin_pos)*
 - The full set of sequences identified by Nair and colleagues as binding cisplatin
 - Approximately 44k sequences from triplicate ChIP-seq assays, mapped to hg38 with loci identified by peak calling
 - MAFFT defaults were used at baseline, then increased and decreased gappenalties were applied (high=2.53, default=1.53, low=0.53)

*AlphaFold3 DNA Input Sequence Subset (af3_dnapos)*
 - A randomized subset of the full Cisplatin Binding Sequence set ~256 sequences
 - These sequences were originally transcribed to be fed as input to AlphaFold3 to obtain predicted RNA-Cisplatin complexes, however, the results were found to be unreliable upon post-generation analysis. Structures frequently contained broken phosphate backbones or exhibited implausible torsion angles.
 - MAFFT defaults were used

*AlphaFold3 RNA Input Sequence Subset (af3_rnapos)*
 - Transcribed RNA sequences from the DNA subset above
 - MAFFT defaults were used
