# Hidden-State-Genomics
ClinGen is starting to explore the utility of machine learning tools for their curation efforts, and the aim here is to predict HGVS annotations based on nucleotide sequence information alone, while providing interpretable feature activations to explain model behavior. This provides two key benefits over tools like AlphaMissense: (1) predictions can be made on variants that occur in non-coding regions, and (2) feature activations can be used to explain model behavior and identify potential gaps in literature being considered..
